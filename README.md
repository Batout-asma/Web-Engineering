# Web Engineering Repo

This repository contains a collection of web engineering tasks (TPs) using different technologies such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Bootstrap**, **jQuery**, **Laravel**, and **WordPress**. The repository is designed to showcase various front-end and back-end web development techniques.

## Setup Instructions

To run the PHP and Ajax-based projects locally, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Install XAMPP**  
   If you havenâ€™t already, download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), which provides the necessary server environment (Apache, MySQL, PHP, etc.).

2. **Copy Files to XAMPP Directory**  
   Copy all the files from this repository and paste them into the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation (typically found at `C:\xampp\htdocs\`).

3. **Start XAMPP Server**  
   Open the XAMPP control panel and start both the **Apache** and **MySQL** servers.

4. **Access the Project in Your Browser**  
   Once the servers are running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/web-engineering/` to view the project.
